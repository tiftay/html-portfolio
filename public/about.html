<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Tiffany Taylor. I'm an accomplished IT professional with a strong focus on client satisfaction
  and a practical background in continuous improvement. My journey began in the provincial government of
  Ontario, where I gained recognition as a subject matter expert and received recognition for my technical
  comprehension and teamwork abilities, which naturally led to my progression into the field of IT. During
  a period of self-employment, I honed my skills and provided strategic technical guidance to online
  businesses.

  <p>After deciding to take advantage of my dual citizenship and moving to the U.S., my career took an
    exciting turn into the higher education sector, where I've excelled in delivering solutions at an
    enterprise level. I possess a unique talent for simultaneously handling the big picture and fine
    details, thriving on complex problem-solving while embracing creative challenges.
  </p>

<p>This brings us to today, where I've decided to further enhance my existing programming knowledge in
  order to broaden my opportunities within the field of information technology. Based on my current
  knowledge and my time spent researching, I am certain I can thrive in a career in either software or
  web development.
